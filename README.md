# Real vs AI-Generated Image Classification using Hybrid Deep Learning Models

This repository contains the coursework for INM705: Deep Learning for Image Analysis as part of the MSc in Artificial Intelligence at City, University of London.

## Overview

This project explores different model architectures to address this issue:

- **CNN with Frequency Domain (FD)**: Uses Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to capture hidden frequency-based artifacts.
- **Swin Transformer**: A hierarchical vision transformer designed to extract spatial features efficiently.
- **Hybrid Model**: Combines both approaches to leverage frequency domain and spatial features for boost the classification performance.
